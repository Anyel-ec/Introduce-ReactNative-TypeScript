# React Native Project

This project is a React Native application consisting of two screens:

1. **Screen1**: This screen displays a welcome message and an image. It also has a button to navigate to the second screen.
   
2. **Screen2**: On this screen, users can input two numbers and then press a button to divide them. The result of the division is displayed below the input fields.
